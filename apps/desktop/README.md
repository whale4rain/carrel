# @carrel/desktop

The Carrel desktop app: Electron main process (bundled with esbuild) and a
React renderer (bundled with Vite).

## Run

```sh
pnpm dev                                   # build and open
pnpm --filter @carrel/desktop smoke        # start, check the shell renders, quit
```

## Frames

- **Mac:** hidden inset title bar; the traffic lights sit over the sidebar,
  whose top and the top bar move the window.
- **Windows:** the app draws a title strip; the native minimize, maximize and
  close buttons sit on it (`titleBarOverlay`) and follow the theme.
- **Other platforms:** the system frame.

The theme follows the system's light or dark mode.

For screenshots, these environment variables pick what you'd see elsewhere:

| Variable | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `CARREL_FRAME=mac\|windows` | Draw that platform's frame (the traffic lights themselves only show on a Mac) |
| `CARREL_THEME=day\|night` | Force a theme |
| `CARREL_SHOT=file.png` | Save the page as a PNG and quit |
